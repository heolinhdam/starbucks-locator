# starbucks-locator
***Starbucks_locator can locate all the Starbucks based on search criteria***   

This is the project I did in college as final exam. I built a program that allows user to locate starbucks around them by inputting in their zipcode, city and the radius in miles they want to show. The program will return a map with all the locations it found, also identifying whether the location has drive-through.   

You can run starbucks.py to see. I will learn to create a webapp that allows you to run online in the future.   
Here is what the map looks like
